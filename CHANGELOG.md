### Framework Simplification

- Removed legacy training modes and old compatibility configs.
- Kept only:
  - `configs/quick.yml` for smoke tests;
  - `configs/stack.yml` for the current baseline and submit artifact source.
- Main trainer is now a single grouped OOF ensemble:
  - LightGBM/CatBoost/XGBoost base models;
  - non-negative hill-climb blend on OOF predictions;
  - PF_ANCC delta postprocess and smoothing tuned on OOF;
  - one artifact format used by local and Kaggle inference.
- `make train` trains `configs/stack.yml`.
- `make quick-train` trains `configs/quick.yml`.
- `make submit` is inference-only Kaggle submit from `artifacts/stack`.

Takeaway: the framework is back to a simple baseline shape. New ideas should be
added to the main path only when they improve validation or leaderboard.

### Audit Fix Pass

- Fixed latent `TVT`-missing target-mask bug.
- Removed duplicate `idx_since` and `md_since` features; postprocess now uses
  `md_from_last_known`.
- Moved low-resolution DTW dynamic programming into numba.
- Added inference warnings for missing feature columns and zero-filled them.
- Expanded full-stack residual-weight grid to `[0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1]`.
- Added pytest coverage for target masks, feature schema, postprocess, DTW,
  XGBoost early stopping, and inference feature filling.
- Local result: pending.
- Kaggle result: pending.

### EXP-20260517-1 - Initial HGB Baseline

- Command/config: historical HGB baseline.
- Data: 773 train wells, 3,783,989 train rows.
- Local result:
  - 150-well CV RMSE: 16.63554;
  - flat baseline CV RMSE: 19.06126;
  - final train RMSE: 6.61516.
- Kaggle result: public LB 12.803.
- Runtime: local training around 6-7 minutes.
- Takeaway: useful first baseline, but sklearn boosting was not the right tool
  and validation was noisy.

### EXP-20260517-2 - First GBM Stack

- Command/config: historical stack config before simplification.
- Data: 773 train wells, 3,783,989 train rows.
- Local result:
  - all-well CV RMSE: 13.50285;
  - flat baseline RMSE: 17.50671;
  - final train RMSE: 4.64289;
  - features: 131.
- Kaggle result: public LB 13.033.
- Runtime: local training around 38 minutes.
- Takeaway: better local CV, worse public LB than HGB. The framework needed
  stronger alignment and cleaner artifact inference before more tuning.

### EXP-20260517-3 - Inference-Only Submit Path

- What changed:
  - local training produces reusable artifacts;
  - Kaggle kernel can run inference only from a private artifact dataset;
  - this avoids retraining all models inside the 9-hour Kaggle notebook budget.
- Takeaway: this is the right submit workflow while experiments are trained
  locally.

### EXP-20260517-4 - 9.251-Style Baseline Smoke

- Command/config: `make quick-train` / `configs/quick.yml`.
- Data: public sample, 3 train wells and 3 public test wells.
- Local result:
  - rows: 14,151;
  - features: 174;
  - baseline: `last_known_tvt`;
  - baseline RMSE: 11.53934;
  - OOF ensemble RMSE: 9.72345;
  - OOF + postprocess RMSE: 9.56255;
  - selected weight: `xgb_quick=1.0`;
  - best PF blend: `{alpha: 1.05, tau: 100.0, w_pf: 0.25}`;
  - best smoothing: `{window: 17, polyorder: 3}`.
- Kaggle result: not submitted.
- Takeaway: alignment features and OOF-tuned postprocess work on the smoke set.
  Needs full `make train` after simplification.
